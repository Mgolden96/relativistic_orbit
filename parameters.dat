These conditions give an interesting and stable orbit.

radius, dr/dtau, dtheta/dtau are self explanitory

use_circular (if set to 1) fixes dtheta/dtau so that the orbit will be circular.
    It still allows you to change dr/dtau to perturb circular orbits.
    Any input dtheta/dtau will be ignored unless use_circular != 1

max_tau is the end proper time of the simulation

dtau is the timestep

every detemrines how often the system is written to a file.
    if every = 100, then every 100 timesteps the system will be recorded.
